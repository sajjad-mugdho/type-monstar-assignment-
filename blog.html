            <h2>Local Storage Vs. Session Storage</h2>
            <p>
                <strong>Session Storage:</strong>The sessionStorage object stores data only
                for a session. It means that the data stored in the sessionStorage temporary it
                will be deleted when the browser is closed.
                <strong>Local Storage:</strong> localStorage continues
                to store data after the browser is closed. It means that data stored permanently information for reuse i
                future
                in localStorage does not expire.

            <h2>Global Scope Vs. Block Scope</h2>
            <p>
                <strong>Block Scope:</strong>A variable when declared inside the if or switch conditions or inside for
                or while loops, are accessible within that
                particular condition or loop. To be consise the variables declared inside the curly braces are called as
                within block
                scope.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Global Scope:</strong>The Javascript global scope is the context where everything in a Javascript
                program executes by default. This scope
                includes all variables, objects, and references that are not contained within a customized scope defined
                by a
                programmer. Global scope is the entire Javascript execution environment.

            <h2>What is Event Loop?</h2>
            <p><strong>Event Loop:</strong>The event loop is a constantly running process that monitors both the
                callback queue and the call stack. If the call
                stack is not empty, the event loop waits until it is empty and places the next function from the
                callback queue to the
                call stack.

            <h2>When do we get <i>undefined</i> in JavaScript?</h2>
            <p>
                <strong>1. When variables value is not defined</strong><br>
                <strong>2. When a function does not return anything it return
                    undefined.</strong><br>
                <strong>3. When you try to access a property of an object that does not
                    exist.</strong><br>
